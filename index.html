            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Text-to-Speech Application:
            <p>Created a Python-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) app that allows users to convert text into speech, save it as MP3 files, and play the audio directly within the app. The app includes a user-friendly GUI, developed using Kivy, and provides notifications when a file is saved. It was further packaged into an APK file for Android devices using Buildozer and Google Colab.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>PDF Line-by-Line Audio Reader:
        <p>
            Designed a PDF reader application that reads out one line at a time from a loaded PDF file. The app features a dynamic GUI built with Kivy, integrates PyPDF2 for extracting text, and uses gTTS for generating audio. Users can load a PDF, view its content, and play each sentence sequentially by pressing the Play button.
        </p>
         </li>
       </li>
        <li> Linear Equation Solver:
        <p>
             Created a Python-based Linear Equation Solver that allows users to solve systems of linear
 equations using Cramer's Rule. The app features a user-friendly GUI, developed using Kivy, where
 users can input the coefficients and constants of the equations dynamically. The app calculates
 the solutions step-by-step and displays them in a popup. It also handles invalid inputs, such as
 cases where the determinant is zero. The results are easily accessible, and users can reset the fields
 with a clear button. Additionally, this application was packaged into an APK file for Android devices
 using Buildozer, allowing users to solve equations on their mobile devices.
